<p class="abc">Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Considered one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes, he has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.</p>

<p class="pqr">Spider-Man has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker who was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in Queens, New York City after the death of his parents. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and his "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.[10] Unlike previous teen heroes, Spider-man was not a sidekick nor did he have a mentor. He would be given many supporting characters, such as his boss J. Jonah Jameson; friends like Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn; romantic interests like Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, durability, agility and reflexes; clinging to surfaces and ceilings; and detecting danger with his precognitive "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and "web swinging" across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar that he could have stopped but did not, Peter learned "with great power comes great responsibility" and began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man.</p>
